# ThinkSync
ThinkSync is a meticulously crafted full-stack application built with MongoDB, Express, and Node.jsâ€”leveraging the MEN stack from MERN. This project showcases my expertise in seamless CRUD operations, structured API routing, and middleware-driven request handling using Express.js.

User authentication is securely implemented with Passport.js, ensuring robust session management and identity verification. The application is actively evolving, with authorization mechanisms in development to enforce granular access control and enhance security.

Stay tuned as ThinkSync continues to grow into a feature-rich and secure journaling platform!
